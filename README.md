AVLStudentDB is a student database system that uses an AVL tree to store and manage records efficiently.
By maintaining balance after each operation, it ensures high performance with O(logn) time complexity for insert, delete, search, etc.
This project highlights scalable and structured data management using self-balancing trees.
